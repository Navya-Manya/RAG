# RAG Chat BOT

The Retrieval Augmented Generation Chat Bot combines LangChain, Streamlit, and Pinecone to create a powerful tool for generating responses based on user queries. Here's an overview of how it works:

LangChain: LangChain is a library for building conversational AI systems. It provides tools for text processing, document retrieval, embeddings, and more.

Streamlit: Streamlit is a Python library for building interactive web applications. It allows you to create user interfaces with simple Python scripts.

Pinecone: Pinecone is a vector database service that provides fast and scalable similarity search for high-dimensional vectors. It's particularly useful for storing and querying embeddings generated by machine learning models.

Now, let's break down the key components and functionalities of the RAGE system:

Document Loading: Documents are loaded into the system using the load_documents function. This function reads PDF files from a directory and returns a list of documents.

Document Splitting: The split_documents function splits the text content of each document into smaller chunks. This is done to improve retrieval performance and handle large documents more efficiently.

Embedding Generation: Depending on the configuration chosen by the user, embeddings are generated either using a local vector database (Chroma) or Pinecone. The embeddings_on_local_vectordb and embeddings_on_pinecone functions handle this process.

User Interface: The input_fields function creates input fields in the Streamlit sidebar for users to input API keys and other parameters. Users can also upload documents using a file uploader widget.

Document Processing: When the user clicks the "Submit Documents" button, the process_documents function is called. This function processes the uploaded documents, generates embeddings, and stores them in the chosen vector database.

Chat Interface: The main interaction with the system happens through a chat interface. Users can input queries, and the system responds with relevant information based on the retrieved documents and embeddings.

Conversation History: The system maintains a history of chat messages, displaying both user queries and system responses in the chat interface.

Query Processing: User queries are processed using the query_llm function, which combines document retrieval with language model-based response generation. The system retrieves relevant documents based on the query and generates a response using a conversational language model (LLM).

Launch Function: The launch function brings everything together by setting up the Streamlit app, displaying input fields and chat messages, and handling user queries.

Overall, the RAGE system provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with conversational AI models and retrieve information from large document collections. It leverages the capabilities of LangChain, Streamlit, and Pinecone to deliver a seamless user experience with powerful backend functionality.
